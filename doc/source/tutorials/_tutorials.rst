Tutorials
=========

The following tutorials are provided to familiarize beginners with the features 
and typical workflow of NekRS. For a user brand new to NekRS, we strongly 
recommend beginning with the fully developed laminar flow tutorial.

**N.B.** Some of these tutorials have been adapted from those in the Nek5000
documentation (https://nek5000.github.io/NekDoc/tutorials.html)
